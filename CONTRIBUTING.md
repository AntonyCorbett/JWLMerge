# How to contribute

Thanks for thinking about contributing additional code or bug fixes to the project.

## Submitting changes

Please send a Pull Request with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). 
When you send a pull request, please follow our coding conventions and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look include a more comprehensive description.

## Coding conventions

A StyleCop ruleset file is used to help maintain consistent coding conventions. 
The projects reference the StyleCop.Analyzers assembly so it should be possible to stick to the coding style without too much difficulty.

Many thanks
Antony Corbett
